Getting started
===============

Welcome to the documentation of the Chassis Automation prototype.
Chassis Automation is a standalone prototype based on Kaiser Software's `Chassis
<http://chassis-docs.readthedocs.io/en/test/>`_.
The goal of Chassis Automation is to discover the possibilities of system processes
automation using a customized `Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN)
<http://www.bpmn.org/>`_ workflow designer.

Front- and back-end
-------------------

The Chassis Automation prototype makes use of a front-end Angular 5 project called ``chassis-automation-client``,
which handles the user interaction. For the back-end, Chassis Automation uses a Laravel 5 API called ``chassis-automation-api``.
The API handles all back-end logic.

To set up the front-end project, please follow the instructions given in: :doc:`/frontend/index`.

To set up the back-end project, please follow the instruction given in: :doc:`/backend/index`.
