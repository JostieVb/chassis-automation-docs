Front-end Installation
======================

Chassis Automation's front-end was generated with Angular CLI version 1.7.0.
Therefore, you need to install `Angular CLI
<https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/>`_ if you don't have it installed yet.

Development server
------------------

Clone the project from Github. To run a development server locally, navigate to the project folder
and run ``ng serve``. The app will be available on ``http://localhost:9000`` and will automatically reload
if you change any of the source files.
