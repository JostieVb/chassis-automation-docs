Introduction
============

Angular let's you extend html elements with new attributes called **directives**.
Angular has some built-in directives, like ``ngFor``, ``ngIf`` and ``ngSwitch``.
You can also define your own directives. Chassis Automation uses two custom directives:

* ``form``
* ``caller``

More information about these directives will be given below.

.. include:: form-directive

.. include:: caller-directive
